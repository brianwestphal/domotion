/**
 * Captured-text addressing engine (docs/101, the caret + selection track's
 * geometry source; designed in docs/100 "Primitive 2").
 *
 * Resolves a `{ target, charOffset }` address — and `charStart`/`charEnd`
 * ranges — NODE-SIDE against a captured element tree. The captured
 * `TextSegment`s carry per-UTF-16-code-unit `xOffsets` (Chromium's painted x,
 * subpixel, viewport-absolute) and a line-box top `y`; the element carries
 * `fontAscent` / `fontDescent` (Chrome's own `measureText` metrics). So a caret
 * lands on *Chromium's* painted x with no live-page probe and no hand-tuned
 * `dy ≈ ascent` constant.
 *
 * **Target resolution (design decision).** A captured tree has no CSS-selector
 * engine, so selectors are resolved at CAPTURE time by stamping
 * `data-domotion-anim="<id>"` on the matching element — the exact mechanism
 * intra-frame animations already use (`src/cli/animate.ts` tags the live DOM,
 * CAPTURE_SCRIPT lifts the attribute into `CapturedElement.animId`). This
 * engine then finds the element by `animId`. That is the least-new-machinery
 * path: zero new capture code, and authors writing raw HTML fixtures can stamp
 * the attribute themselves. A `match` predicate is the programmatic escape
 * hatch for callers holding the tree (tests, imperative pipelines). The
 * declarative config surface maps `selector` → stamped animId at capture time.
 *
 * **Indexing.** Addresses count Unicode CODE POINTS (an astral pair is one
 * position) across the target's text runs concatenated in reading order.
 * `xOffsets` arrays are per UTF-16 code unit (a surrogate pair carries two
 * entries at the same painted x), so the engine converts code-point offsets to
 * UTF-16 indices per run before reading them. Because each run carries its OWN
 * text + xOffsets, this per-run conversion composes correctly even when
 * consecutive runs come from DIFFERENT captured elements (mixed content).
 *
 * **Mixed content (DM-1756).** The address resolves over the target's whole
 * SUBTREE, not just its own text nodes: `<p>plain <b>bold</b> tail</p>` (or a
 * syntax-highlighted code line tokenized into `<span>`s) is one logical string
 * whose `charOffset` spans the children. The captured tree stores a parent's
 * own text segments (`el.textSegments`) and its child elements (`el.children`)
 * SEPARATELY — the DOM interleave order between them is not preserved — so the
 * engine reconstructs reading order from Chromium's painted geometry: runs are
 * grouped into lines by baseline (a `<sub>`/`<sup>` stays on its line; a wrapped
 * or `display:block` child starts a new line) and ordered left-to-right by
 * captured `x` within each line. For horizontal LTR inline flow that visual
 * order equals DOM/logical order (see `src/render/paint-order.ts` for the
 * distinct element z-order paint sort — reading order here is a separate,
 * text-flow concern). Each descendant run keeps ITS OWN font metrics /
 * baseline / xOffsets, so the per-run geometry is exact across child boundaries.
 * Whitespace is taken verbatim from what Chromium captured — the leading /
 * trailing spaces inside a text run (`"plain "`, `" tail"`) are preserved; the
 * engine never synthesizes a space at a child boundary. (Consequence: a
 * pure-whitespace text node between two inline children is dropped at capture —
 * all-whitespace segments aren't emitted — so it isn't part of the addressed
 * string; see the Limits section of docs/101.)
 *
 * **Regression safety.** When the target has no descendant element that
 * contributes any run (the single-element and input-value cases), the engine
 * returns the target's own runs in captured order UNCHANGED — the paint-order
 * merge only runs for genuinely mixed content, so existing single-element /
 * bidi-fragment / input behavior is byte-for-byte preserved.
 *
 * **Bidi / RTL (logical-order addressing).** Capture keeps a run's characters in
 * DOM/LOGICAL order while `xOffsets[i]` is the char's VISUAL painted x (see
 * `src/capture/script/walker/text-segments.ts`), so `charOffset` already counts
 * logical positions — but the GEOMETRY has to be read through the bidi levels:
 * inside an RTL run the position "before code point N" is that character's RIGHT
 * edge, not its left, and a logical range covers one visually-separate rectangle
 * per bidi level run. Levels come from `bidi-js`'s `getEmbeddingLevels` over the
 * element's concatenated logical text with the element's CSS `direction` as the
 * paragraph direction — the same library and whole-paragraph resolution the
 * renderer's paired-bracket mirroring uses (`applyBidi` / `applyBidiAt` in
 * `src/render/text.ts`). Verified against Chromium: the level runs bidi-js
 * resolves reproduce Chrome's own `Range.getClientRects()` fragmentation of a
 * mixed Hebrew/Latin line exactly. Pure-LTR runs skip the whole path and keep
 * their previous geometry byte-for-byte.
 *
 * **Fallback.** When a run has no captured `xOffsets` (e.g. some input paths),
 * per-character advances come from fontkit via the same
 * resolve-key → font-instance path the typing overlay's `overlayAdvances`
 * uses, anchored at the run's captured `x`.

 * null when the target doesn't resolve, the range is empty, or out of range.
 *
 * **Bidi.** A logical range over mixed-direction text is visually
 * DISCONTIGUOUS, so a covered run additionally splits at every bidi level
 * change: one rect per level run, each carrying its own sweep direction
 * (`rtl` grows right-to-left). Rects stay in LOGICAL order, so the sweep runs in
 * reading order regardless of where the pieces land on screen. This reproduces
 * Chromium's own selection fragmentation — measured against
 * `Range.getClientRects()` on mixed Hebrew/Latin lines in both LTR and RTL
 * paragraphs, the rect boundaries agree exactly.
